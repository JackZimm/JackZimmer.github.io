            In the sport world, the dynamic between fans and players is limited to short periods: before the game, after 
            the game, or seeing them in public. As fans, we usually like a sport, follow a team, and eventually pick a 
            favorite player. We buy jerseys for this player and support them whenever possible. What would make this even 
            better for fans would be a way to be able to talk with players, or ask them questions before and after the game.

            Here at Locker Room Sports, we aim to increase the fan to player interaction and better the way that fans view 
            and think about the players. Before every game, players will have the ability to go live with the fans and 
            answer questions asked. With this new feature, people from all over, who wouldn't normally have the opportunity, 
            can now have an interaction and increase their love of the sport and their favorite player.

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            </div>
        <p>
            We are average fans, just like many of you, who want to be more involved in the game and are working on that very goal. Through our 
            love of the game, and our knowledge of the game, we are architecting an experience that everybody will love. In addition to fans getting 
            to know more about players, we want to give the players a chance to interact with other players across different sports. This means 
            that a football player can connect with lacrosse player, or a basketball player connecting with a soccer player, and people finding
            similarities with those around them.
